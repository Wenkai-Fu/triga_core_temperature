The rad probe is the probe c, which is wired using Dustin's method.
RTD 1 to 8 is bised, and RTD 9 is the standard wiring method.
The probe is located in the spot which is far from the deliver line.

The pa is the probe a, wired using Kevin's method.
This probe is near the deliver water.
The readout of RTD 9 is weird.
The readout of RTD 1 to 8 is similar with RTD 9 in probe C, i.e., the radiated 
one.
