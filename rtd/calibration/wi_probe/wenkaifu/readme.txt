The three RTD probes (A to C) for UW-Madison were calibrated in 
air 25.3C (*air25.dat),
air 22.3C (*air22.dat),
pool 24 or 25C (pool.dat).

The in-pool results are for checking the calibrated equations from the two air 
points.

The ambient temperatures are measured by thermalcouple.

The connection is:
