V to R:

Resistance = ((Voltage Ref - Voltage read) * 1000) / Voltage read

Where Voltage ref = 2.5 V


R to T:

Temperature = (r - 100) / a

Where a is 0.385 Ohms / C




**** NOTE *****

The lower-most RTD in the probe corresponds to the first voltage channel and the last channel corresponds to the 
highest RTD. 


Notice how every other voltage is approximately the same? The higher voltages can be fed directly into the 
equations to find temperature. To correct the offset in the lower voltages (due to daisy chaining), you can
 add the average difference between (channels 0, 2, 4, 6) and (channels 1,3,5,7) readings before the reactor
 is powered on (since the temperature should be fairly constant) to the readings from channels 1, 3, 5, 7 to
get their corrected values.




Correction ~= Average(Average(V_0), Average(V_2), Average(V_4), Average(V_6) ) - Average(Average(V_1), Average(V_3), Average(V_5), Average(V_7) )


Where V_0, V_1, .... , V_n correspond to the list of all steady state voltages from channel n before the reactor is powered on.


v_cor = v_org + correction


where v_org is a reading from one of the odd channels
and v_cor is the corrected voltage that can now be processed into a temperature using the equations above


Channel 8 is not included in this since it may lie in a non-fuel adjacent region and assumptions
that apply to other channels may not be applicable.
